## This feels like Myspace profile for a girl in her late twenties learning something new.

I'm such a beginner that I don't know what I don't know but, maybe this could be fun. A turn based game between me and my computer.

I'm hoping to learn some new things to do on the computer perhaps. Starting out with python to begin but it's an open journey.

Do not ask me about anything or for help with anything, I do not know.
